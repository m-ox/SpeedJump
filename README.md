# SpeedJump

A light Chrome extension that adds
jump back,
jump forward,
speed increment
and speed decrement options!

Originally built for DevCamp videos so I can fine tune my viewing speed for optimal crunching of information.
Due to how the extension searches generally for SPECIFICALLY and GENERALLY all video elements on the DOM,
it reportedly works for many other applications.

I consider the occasional being able to speed up the occasional sidebar video ad of a mobile game to unrecognizable amounts to be an unintended a feature, not a bug.

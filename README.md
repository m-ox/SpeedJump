# SpeedJump-for-Devcamp

A light Chrome extension that adds
jump back,
jump forward,
speed increment
and speed decrement options!

Originally built for DevCamp videos so I can fine tune my viewing speed.
Due to how the extension searches generally for all video elements on the DOM,
it reportedly works for many other applications.

I consider the occasional video ad being accesible and able to be sped up to unrecognizable amounts to be a feature, not a bug.

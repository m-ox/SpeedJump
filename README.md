# SpeedJump

A light Chrome extension that adds
jump back,
jump forward,
speed increment
and speed decrement options!

Originally built to watch my curriculum faster. Because why wouldn't you let students inject education into their brain faster if they can handle it?
Due to how the extension searches generally for SPECIFICALLY and GENERALLY all <video/> elements on the DOM,
it reportedly works for many other applications.

I consider the occasional "being able to speed up the occasional sidebar video ad of a mobile game to unrecognizable amounts" as an unintended feature, not a bug. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
